Overview
========

This repository contains open grid network models and modeling scripts to 
test and compare different factors/measures (e.g., technoeconomic, social, 
equity, and engineering) that examine practices and policies for 
interconnection queue management and cost allocation.  This repository is 
used for engineering training bootcamps, interconnection study guides, and 
supporting analytic tools for the `i2x project <https://energy.gov/i2x>`_.
