# PSCAD Materials for EMT Bootcamps 

This repository contains presentations and examples for the PSCAD track of 
the NERC/i2X bootcamps in electromagnetic transient (EMT) modeling of 
inverter-based resources (IBR).
 
You may obtain PSCAD models by downloading a zip file, one directory
above this one:
 
- [Plant-Level Session](../Plant-Level.zip) 

## Directory

The models and data located here include:

- **SMIB.pscx**; a switching-model of a 100-MW solar plant
- **std\_SMIB\_test\_sample\_lib.pslx**; components and subsystems to support IBR plant models
- **COMTRADEtest/**; a directory of saved COMTRADE output for post-processing exercises

These models are under development and not yet supported:

- **Average.pscx**; an average-model version of *SMIB.pscx*
- **Gen.pscx**; a rotating machine connected in place of the 100-MW solar plant in *SMIB.pscx*
